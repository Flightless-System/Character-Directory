# Character_Directory

This project is one I made to practice full-stack development with Python. It's a simple website where users can store their characters and even link to their Twitter page. It's made with no specific video game in mind -- simply people who make their own original characters for fun. It's minimalistic and made largely as a test run of what a larger website might hold. Each user can log in, have their own character lists, and favorite others' characters. Users may also view others' lists of characters and favorites. The "forgot password/username" links are not functional ones -- they're just there for flavor.
